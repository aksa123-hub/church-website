                     The Orthodox faithful residing in and around Sooranad North, particularly near the Government High School and Kannamam Market area, were for many years members of their mother parishes—St. Thomas Orthodox Church and St. Mary’s Orthodox Church, Sooranad. Due to the difficulty of travelling long distances to attend Holy Qurbana and other liturgical services, the need for a new parish gradually became evident.A plot of land, adjacent to St. Thomas U.P. School, owned by the Church, was graciously made available. After obtaining the necessary permissions, construction of the new church was initiated by dismantling an old structure within the school premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 22 November 1968, under the leadership Fr. T.G. Geevarghese, the faithful formally entered the church premises. The foundation stone of the church was laid on 28 November 1968.
The parish was officially established in January 1969. The consecration ceremonies were completed on 30 and 31 January 1969.Rev. Fr. T. G. Geevarghese was appointed as the first Vicar, and the parish was named St. Mary’s Salem Orthodox Syrian Church, Sooranad North. Subsequently, the parish committee and various spiritual organizations were formed.From February 1969 onward, regular Holy Qurbana and worship services were conducted. The parish feast in honour of St. Mary was celebrated annually with great devotion. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, several priests served the parish, strengthening its spiritual and organizational life. Youth movements, Sunday School activities, and social service initiatives flourished under their guidance.
Construction of a new church building commenced on 1 February 2007. In 2008 with the wholehearted support of parishioners, the construction progressed steadily under the leadership of Rev. Fr. Solu Koshy Raju (who took the charge as vicar in 2008).The consecration of the renovated church was solemnly conducted on 28 and 29 January 2011 in the presence of revered bishops and clergy.
Today, St. Mary’s Orthodox Syrian Church, Sooranad North, stands as a spiritually vibrant and structurally strong parish, faithfully preserving Orthodox tradition while actively engaging in worship, service, and community life.
